    "#Piezo Stethoscope\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module we will be creating a sthethoscope to monitor our heartbeats via a piezosensor and learn how log and read data. The idea is that if you tape a contact microphone directly to your skin, it will pick up on your pulse and generate a voltage every time your heart beats. We can then view this voltage-plot in real time as well as logging the data to a SD card so it can be analysed later. Using a piezoelectric sensor has been trialed in real clinical settings to as an inexpensive method to monitor heart rate, respiration rate, and other vital functions of the body. \n",

    "You may notice that you don't see a very strong signal and the line is flat when you are sitting still. This is because the default voltage (y- axis) range is zoomed out to (0, 4096). However, we can modify this with the setYRange_sensor_x(low, high) method. For example, I wanted to zoom in on the voltage range (500, 700) on channel two, I would call setYRange_sensor_two(500, 700). Look at the plot and estimate a reasonable range to zoom on onto (about Â±150 volts of the steady voltage) and set this for the necessary plots. Make sure you write this code before you call runPlot(), or comment it out above and write it again."

    "Run the program again, you should see a much clearer graph and see little bumps that indicate your heartbeat. Sit really still and wait for the graphs to stabalize. When the graphs do stabalize, have someone start logging the data onto the SD card. Hold still for about one minute, watching the plot to make sure that there are no huge disturbances.  Once one minute has passed, stop the data logger and close the plotter. Now remove the SD card and insert it into a computer. Open the SD card on the computer and locate/open the data file. There should be several columns, the first one being the time and the next several being the data of each sensor. Use excel to graph the data vs time as a scatter plot. \n",

Think of what we can check to see if we are at a peak or not. Perhaps we can set a threshhold and check to see if we are above that threshhold and the last voltage was below it. But this implementation is prone to error, so we need a way of making it more robust. Discuss with your group/class a way to implement a robust way of peak detection and implement it. \n",
