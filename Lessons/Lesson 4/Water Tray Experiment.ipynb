    "#Wave Amplitude and Velocity\n",
    "\n",
    "##Objectives\n",
    "1. To observe the relationships between the energy of an input source and the _amplitude_ of a wave.\n",
    "2. To observe the relationships between the energy of an input source and the _velocity_ of a wave.\n",
    "\n",
    "##Materials\n",
    "1. One large circular tray (about a meter in diameter)\n",
    "2. One rubber ball\n",
    "3. Timers\n",
    "4. Water\n",
    "5. Corn startch\n",
    "\n",
    "##Introduction\n",
    "A **wave** is a disturbance through a medium that transfers energy. There are two types of waves **transverse** and **longitudinal**. In a transverse wave, the disturbance is perpendicular to the direction of propagation. In a longitudinal wave, the disturbance is parallel to the direction of propagation.\n",

    "\n",
    "Some important properties of waves are their _amplitude_, _frequency_, _velocity_, and _wave length_. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"waveDiagram.jpg\" width=\"60%\"> \n",
    "\n",
    "The amplitude describes how tall the wave is, the velocity describes how long it is. The velocity of the wave describes how fast a wave can propagate and the frequency is how many \"cycles\" or instances of a full wave length the wave can travel in one second.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##Experiment\n",
    "* Fill the cirular tray with water. The water depth must be at least as large as the diameter of the rubber ball.\n",
    "* Have students copy down the following table on paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "|   Water to Corn Starch                        \t|                       1:0 \t|                         8:1 \t|                                4:1 \t|                            2:1 \t|\n",
    "|-----------------------------------------------\t|---------------------------\t|:---------------------------:\t|:----------------------------------:\t|--------------------------------\t|\n",
    "| .5 meter \t|  \t|  \t|  \t|  \t|\n",
    "| 1 meter \t|  \t|  \t|  \t|  \t|\n",
    "| 1.5 meter \t|  \t|  \t|  \t|  \t| |\n",
    "Each entry in the table corresponds to how long the first wave front created by dropping the rubber ball from a certain height takes to reach the edges of the circular tray. Have them record any observations about any patterns about the waves.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Have students record the time taken for the wave to propagate through the water/corn starch solutions\n",
    "* It is recommended to keep the volume of water constant and add corn starch after you are done with the three trials. (For example if in the 1:0 ratio we use 2 litres of water and 0 litres of cornstarch, we would then use .25 litres, .5 litres, and 1 litre of cornstarch)\n",
    "\n",
    "##Questions\n",
    "* Did the height of the ball affect the period of propagation?\n",
    "* What is the velocity of the wave?\n",
    "* Which property is affected by how high initially the ball was?\n",
    "* What kind of wave are we observing when we drop a ball in the pond?\n",
    "* What is the relation between the _viscocity_ (as the percentage of corn starch increases, the velocity increases) of the medium and the period of propagation?\n",
    "\n",
    "##Exploration\n",
    "* Identify other examples of tranverse and longitudinal waves"
