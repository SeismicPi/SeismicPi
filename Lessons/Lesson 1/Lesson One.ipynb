    "If someone were to ask you what color an apple is, you would look at the apple and tell them what color you saw. If they then asked you which smelled better, roses or lillies, you would use your nose to smell both of them. Humans get information around their surroundings through our five senses, sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste. Similarly, robots and computers can collect information by using **sensors**. Sensors are the wardrobe between real life and the digital world. Whenever your favorite singer records a new album, she has to record it using a microphone, which is a sensor that can detect and record sound. When producers record the latest action movie, they use video cameras, which is a sensor that can detect light.\n",

    "\n",
    "There are two main types of sensors, **digital** and **analog**. A digital sensor is one that can record whether a signal is on or off, for example a button. On the other hand, an **analog** sensor is one that can record a spectrum of values, or possibly **infinitly** many. One example is a temperature sensor. If a temperature sensor can record values from $0 ^\\circ$C to $30^\\circ$C. One possible value it can record is $10^\\circ$C, or $15^\\circ$C, or $14.12^\\circ$C, or $3.141592^\\circ$C. If I were to keep on listing numbers, it would be impossible for me to list every single possible value that the sensor could record!\n",
