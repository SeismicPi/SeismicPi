    "Take a brief moment to review what it does. It takes in three parameters, $a$ (position of friend's house), $t$ (time distance of arrival), and $s$ (the speed you and your friend travel at). Now instead of using the metaphor of you and your friend racing home, how can this be used to model the piTap? \n",
    "\n",
    "The setup of piTap is that there are two sensors, connected by a horizontal line. We want to be able to tap anywhere in between the line and predict where we've tapped. This is similar to you and your friend running home, except now it is two waves that are racing towards the sensors. The sensors are analogous to the homes, the position of the tap is is analogous to the location of the hangout spot, and the circular wave front is equivalent to you and your friend running left and right.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know what the value of $a$ is, just the distance beween the two sensors, which we can measure with a meter stick or ruler. We know what $t$ is since we can ask the raspberry Pi what the time difference between the sensors is. However, we do not yet know what $s$ is, and we will need some way of calculating it. From the previous lesson, we asked \"What is the TDOA if you decide to hang out at a location LEFT of your house?\". The answer to this is that it is simply the the time it takes your friend to run to his house from your house. Thus if we tap the board LEFT of the leftmost sensor, the time distance of arrival will be the time it takes the wave to propagate from one sensor to another. And since we know that the distance between the sensors, we can use the formula that $s = \\frac{\\Delta p}{t} = \\frac{a}{t}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "So we could calculate $s$ by tapping the board left of the left-most sensor, retrieve the TDOA and take the quotient of the length and the TDOA. However, since we've only conducted the experiment once, this result could be rather inaccurate. In order to get a more accurate value of $s$, we will want to conduct this experiment multiple times and then take an average of all the experiment results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, write a program that creates an initialliy empty list called \"speeds\" that will eventually contain ten values of the $s$, calculated in ten different trials. Use a ```while``` loop to wait for ten time differences, calculate the speed for that trial and then appends it to speeds. \n",
    "\n",
    "Initialize $a$ at the very beginning to be the length of the distance between the two sensors (which you should measure with a ruler). Finally, run the code block and tap LEFT of the left-most sensor ten times."
