    "The slope of the line is $2$ and the y-intercept is $4$, so the equation is $y(x) = 2x+4$. If we are told that a line goes through two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$, we can also find the equation of the line. We know that since the slope is defined as **rise over run**: $m = \\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$. Now that we have found the slope of the line, how can we find the y-interccept? The line goes through $(x_1, y_1)$ so $y_1 = m*x_1 + c$ and hence $c = y_1-m*x_1$. Alternatively, we also know that the line goes through $(x_2, y_2)$ so $y_2 = m*x_2 + c$ and $c = y_2 - m*x_2$. Now we have found both $m$ and $c$ so we know the equation of the line!\n",

When you leave school and decide to go home, your position will slowly decrease as you walk home until it reaches zero miles. \n",

Since $s$ is the \"slope\" of this graph, we can calculate $s$ by taking the **rise over run** of the graph or **the change in position divided by the change in time**. The time it takes to travel from one one position to  another is the **change in position divided by the speed**. \n",
