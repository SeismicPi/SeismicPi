For your windows system, you need to make sure drivers are correctly installed.
For this go into your Windows Device manager. Your CDC device probably shows up as "JM CDC DEMO".

Update the driver and point to the generated cdc.inf file in the project documentation folder.

Important: follow the steps below to install/update the driver:
- Go to the Device manager and identify the device. Perform an 'update driver'
- IMPORTANT: Select 'Browse my computer for driver software'
- IMPORTANT: select 'let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer'
- use 'show all devices', use 'have disk' and to browse to the cdc.inf file
- this will show up as 'Freescale CDC device' :-)
