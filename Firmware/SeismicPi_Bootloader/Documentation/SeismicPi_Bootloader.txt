Module "SPI_SD"    (component SPIMaster_LDD)
   - SPI_SD_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc.   If the "Enable in init. code" is set to "yes" value 
                then the device is also enabled(see the description of the Enable() method). In this case the Enable() method 
                is not necessary and needn't to be generated.    This method can be called only once. Before the second call of 
                Init() the Deinit() must be called first.
   - SPI_SD_Deinit -This method deinitializes the device. It switches off the device, frees the device data structure memory, 
                interrupts vectors, etc.
   - SPI_SD_SendBlock -Sends a block of characters. The method returns ERR_BUSY when the previous block transmission is not 
                completed. The method <CancelBlockTransmission> can be used to cancel a transmit operation. This method 
                finishes immediately after calling it - it doesn't wait the end of data transmission. Use event <OnBlockSent> 
                to check the end of data transmission or method GetSentDataNum to check the state of sending.
   - SPI_SD_ReceiveBlock -This method specifies the number of data to receive. The method returns ERR_BUSY until the specified 
                number of characters is received. The method <CancelBlockReception> can be used to cancel a running receive 
                operation. If a receive operation is not in progress (the method was not called or a previous operation has 
                already finished) all received characters will be lost without any notification. To prevent the loss of data 
                call the method immediately after the last receive operation has finished (e.g. from the <OnBlockReceived> 
                event). This method finishes immediately after calling it - it doesn't wait the end of data reception. Use 
                event <OnBlockReceived> to check the end of data reception or method GetReceivedDataNum to check the state of 
                receiving.
   - SPI_SD_SelectConfiguration -This method selects attributes of communication from the <Attribute set list> and select a 
                chip select from the <Chip select list>. Once any configuration is selected, a transmission can be started 
                multiple times. This method is available if number of chip selects or number of attribute set is greater than 1.
                If the device doesn't support chip select functionality the ChipSelect parameter is ignored.

   - TimerMillis_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and 
                sets interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the property <"Enable in init. code"> is set to 
                "yes" value then the device is also enabled (see the description of the <Enable> method). In this case the 
                <Enable> method is not necessary and needn't to be generated. This method can be called only once. Before the 
                second call of Init the <Deinit> must be called first.
   - TimerMillis_Deinit -Deinitializes the device. Switches off the device, frees the device data structure memory, interrupts 
                vectors, etc.

                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the "Enable in init. code" property is set to "yes" 
                (<Enabled in init. code>) value then the device is also enabled(see the description of the Enable() method). In 
                this case the Enable() method is not necessary and needn't to be generated. This method can be called only once.

                (property <Read batch size>) by periodical calling the component’s Main method in the user application (higher 
                level OS service).
   - FLASH_Write -This method sets up a flash memory write operation. The operation itself is performing by defined batches 
                (property <Write batch size>) by periodical calling the component’s Main method in the user application (higher 
                level OS service) or by the component’s ISR, if an component’s interrupt service is enabled.
   - FLASH_Erase -This method sets up a flash memory erase operation. The operation itself is performing by defined batches 
                (property <Erase batch size>) by periodical calling the component’s Main method in the user application (higher 
                level OS service) or by the component’s ISR, if an component’s interrupt service is enabled.
   - FLASH_GetOperationStatus -Returns a status of current (last) flash memory operation.
   - FLASH_Main -This method is used to perform one batch of a flash memory operation. This method is used to perform batches 
                of all flash memory operations (Write, Read, Erase, EraseBlock, VerifyErasedBlock) when the component works in 
                the polled mode (interrupt service is disabled - property <Interrupt service>). This method performs batches of 
                the read flash memory operation, when the component works in the interrupt triggered mode (interrupt service is 
                enabled). This method is enabled only if the component works in the polled mode or if the Read method is 
                enabled.

Module "BL_SW"     (component BitIO)
   - BL_SW_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property for 
                limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].

   - WAIT1_Waitns -Wait for a specified time in nano seconds.
   - WAIT1_WaitOSms -If an RTOS is enabled, this routine will use a non-blocking wait method. Otherwise it will do a 
                busy/blocking wait.

Module "UART"      (component AsynchroSerial)
   - UART_RecvChar -If any data is received, this method returns one character, otherwise it returns an error code (it does not 
                wait for data). This method is enabled only if the receiver property is enabled.  [Note:] Because the preferred 
                method to handle error and break exception in the interrupt mode is to use events <OnError> and <OnBreak> the 
                return value ERR_RXEMPTY has higher priority than other error codes. As a consequence the information about an 
                exception in interrupt mode is returned only if there is a valid character ready to be read.
   - UART_SendChar -Sends one character to the channel. If the component is temporarily disabled (Disable method) SendChar 
                method only stores data into an output buffer. In case of a zero output buffer size, only one character can be 
                stored. Enabling the component (Enable method) starts the transmission of the stored data. This method is 
                available only if the transmitter property is enabled.
   - UART_RecvBlock -If any data is received, this method returns the block of the data and its length (and incidental error), 
                otherwise it returns an error code (it does not wait for data).  This method is available only if non-zero 
                length of the input buffer is defined and the receiver property is enabled.  If less than requested number of 
                characters is received only the available data is copied from the receive buffer to the user specified 
                destination. The value ERR_EXEMPTY is returned and the value of variable pointed by the Rcv parameter is set to 
                the number of received characters.
   - UART_SendBlock -Sends a block of characters to the channel.  This method is available only if non-zero length of the 
                output buffer is defined and the transmitter property is enabled.
   - UART_ClearRxBuf -Clears the receive buffer.  This method is available only if non-zero length of the input buffer is 
                defined and the receiver property is enabled.
   - UART_ClearTxBuf -Clears the transmit buffer.  This method is available only if non-zero length of the output buffer is 
                defined and the receiver property is enabled.
   - UART_GetCharsInRxBuf -Returns the number of characters in the input buffer. This method is available only if the receiver 
                property is enabled.
   - UART_GetCharsInTxBuf -Returns the number of characters in the output buffer. This method is available only if the 
                transmitter property is enabled.

Module "Cpu"       (component MK22FN128LH10)
   - Cpu_SystemReset -This method initiates a system reset request to reset the CPU.
